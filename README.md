- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jackkru. I'm a recent graduate looking for a job in data science. Ideally I am looking for an opportunity to use #data4good, but am not limiting myself in my initial search for experience - any opportunities that allow for solving interesting problems using data science are compelling to me. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many data science sub-fields, and am looking to learn more about my interests through real-world experience. My thesis focused on using Natural Language Processing to detect the presence of bias in news media headlines, meaning NLP is the sub-field in which I have the most experience. Machine Learning classification and clustering problems more generally interest me as well, along with AI ethics. An ideal job using #data4good would focus on economic inequality and demographics.
- ðŸŒ± Most of my work, including most of my Master's degree, has been done using Python. I have also used R extensively. I have expertise in numerous packages, including those focused on Machine Learning, Web Scraping, and Natural Language Processing. 
- ðŸ“« I can be reached by email jackkru@gmail.com.
